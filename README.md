# PY-Network-Attack-Detection-App

## Overview

The Network Attack Detection System is a web application designed to analyze network data, predict potential attacks, and diagnose network issues. It consists of a backend API built with Django and a frontend interface developed with React.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch network data from the server using the provided API endpoints.
- **Prediction**: Utilize machine learning models to predict potential network attacks based on input data.
- **Diagnosis**: Diagnose network issues and provide insights into the health of the network.
- **Real-time Updates**: Display real-time updates on the frontend as new data becomes available.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- Django: Web framework for building the API.
- Machine Learning Framework (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn): Used for network attack prediction.

### Frontend

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive design.
